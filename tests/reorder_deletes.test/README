Test reordering of deletes: deletes into table t1 in a random order will have
indices conflicting in the order of page locks thus resulting in deadlocks
(if not reordered).
With reorder on there should fewer deadlocks (yet still a large number more 
than in the insert case).

With reorder off the conflicts arise in the indices, so we expect much more 
( > 300) deadlocks.
