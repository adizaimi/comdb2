This tests that when replicant dies after sending the block processor
commands to master, and client will reconnect to a new node attempting
to replay and the replay will be caught by master blkseq and will return
success/failure code from the first time it ran the transaction.

The reason this works is because we now send client generated cnonce 
to uniquely identify transactions in blkseq, and replicant failing does
not cause duplicate inserts when client retries because master will find
result of the original insert in blockseq, and simply return the rc.
